# Word Connect Game

The **Word Connect Game** is an interactive, React-based game where players match related words from a group. The game is customizable with adjustable settings for group size, number of items, and grid layout, making it a dynamic and engaging learning tool.

### Features:
- **Matching Logic**: Players match related words (e.g., capital cities with their countries or related objects).
- **Visual Feedback**: Correct matches turn green, while incorrect ones remain unchanged.
- **Disappearing Matches**: Matched words disappear from the grid.
- **Track Attempts**: The total number of attempts made by the user is dynamically tracked.
- **Customizable Settings**: 
  - Group Size: Define how many words belong to a group (e.g., 2, 3, or 4).
  - Item Count: Specify the total number of items to match (e.g., 8, 12, or 16).
  - Number of Columns: Adjust the grid layout by setting the number of columns.
- **Responsive Grid Layout**: The layout of the grid adapts based on the number of columns.
